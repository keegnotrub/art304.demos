Links & Images: Absolute and relative paths
===========================================

This is an example of how you might link multiple pages and images
together. Please note the following:

* Examples of relative links can be found throughout
* In `starters.html` under the `menu` directory you can find examples
  of anchored links
* In `contact-us.html` you will find a `target` link for Twitter and
  Facebook
* In `contact-us.html` you will also find a `mailto` link
* A linked image has been created at the header of each page
