Tapenade
========

This is a really simple dish to prepare and it's always a big hit at
parities.  My father recommends:

> Make this the night before so that the flavors have time to
> blend. Just bring it up to room temperature before you serve it. In
> the winder, try serving it warm.  

Ingredients
-----------

* 1 8oz. jar sundried tomatoes
* 2 large garlic cloves
* 2/3 c. kalamata olives
* 1 t. capers

Instructions
------------

1. Combine tomatoes & garlic in a food processor. Blend until as small
   as possible.

2. Add capers and olives. Pulse the motor a few times until they are
   incorporated, but still retain some texture.

   (optional).
