Custom Fonts: Using font-face
=============================

This site shows how to use font-face to layout a custom font on both
paragraph and heading type text. Within the header custom kerning has
been applied. The quote on the bottom has been set custom as well.

Please note that the font-face used in these examples is only using
truetype. Your work should always include all formats (svg, woff, etc)
in order to support all browsers.
